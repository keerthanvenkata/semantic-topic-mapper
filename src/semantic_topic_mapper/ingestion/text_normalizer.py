# Minimal text normalization for parsing.
#
# In scope: strip weird whitespace, normalize line endings.
# Out of scope (per assumptions): reconstruct layout, columns, tables,
# visual indentation from PDFs, or infer bullets from indentation.
# Keeps normalization lightweight to avoid overengineering.
