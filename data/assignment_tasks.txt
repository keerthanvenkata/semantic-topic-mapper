SEMANTIC DOCUMENT INTELLIGENCE ASSIGNMENT
==========================================

TASK 1: Semantic Topic Mapping
------------------------------

Objective:
Create an intelligent document navigation system.

Requirements:

1. Extract ALL topics from the document (not just sequentially numbered ones)

2. Build a topic relationship map showing:
   - Parent-child hierarchies (e.g., Topic 5 → 5.1 → 5.1.a)
   - Cross-references (e.g., Topic 12 "See Topic 8")
   - Forward references (e.g., Topic 3 mentions "as detailed in Topic 22")
   - Backward references (e.g., Topic 30 modifies Topic 4)

3. Identify "orphan content"
   Text that is not clearly associated with any topic.

Agentic Challenge:

Design an agent that can:
- Automatically detect topic boundary ambiguities
- Flag when topic numbering is inconsistent
- Handle appendices that insert new subtopics

Deliverables:

- topic_map.json
  Complete topic hierarchy

- cross_reference_graph.pdf
  Visual relationship diagram

- navigation_agent_design.md
  Architecture for intelligent navigation

- ambiguity_report.csv
  Flagged issues with resolution strategies

Hidden Trap:

Topic 18.3 exists, but Topic 18.2 is missing.
Topic 18 cross-references 18.2.

How does your agent handle this?

TASK 2: Entity Recognition & Classification
-------------------------------------------

Objective:
Build an entity extraction system.

Requirements:

1. Identify ALL entities mentioned in the document, including:

   Organizational:
   - Government bodies
   - Oversight committees

   Roles:
   - Investors
   - Advisors
   - Other defined participants

   Temporal:
   - Deadlines
   - Grace periods
   - Time-bound obligations

2. Create entity profiles containing:
   - Entity ID and type
   - First mention location
   - All references throughout the document
   - Relationships to other entities
   - Obligations and rights associated with each entity

Agentic Challenge:

Design an agentic pipeline using a modern technology stack.

Deliverables:

- entity_catalogue.csv
  Complete entity inventory

- entity_relationships.json
  Graph structure of relationships

- entity_extraction_pipeline.pdf
  Agent architecture

- disambiguation_logics.md
  Logic for resolving entity references

Hidden Trap:

"Zone-C Advisors" appears multiple times, but "Zone-C" is never clearly defined in the document.

How does your system handle undefined or partially defined entities?
