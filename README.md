# Semantic Topic Mapper

Semantic Topic Mapper is a deterministic + LLM-assisted system for extracting
structured knowledge from complex regulatory-style documents.

It identifies:

- Topic hierarchies
- Cross-references between sections
- Entities and their roles
- Structural and semantic ambiguities

This project focuses on **system design, structured parsing, and auditable knowledge graph construction** — not chatbot-style summarization.

## Status

Early architecture and structural parsing phase.

## Input

Plain text documents (PDFs converted to text beforehand).

## Outputs

- Topic hierarchy map
- Cross-reference graph
- Entity catalogue and relationships
- Ambiguity and consistency report
